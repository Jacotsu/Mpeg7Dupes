MpegDupes Is a tool built for comparing binary MPEG7 signatures that have been generated by FFMPEG

# Installation
## Ubuntu (19.10)
### Install [slog](https://github.com/kala13x/slog)
### Install necessary packages
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libavcodec-dev libavfilter-dev
```
### Install Mpeg7Dupes
```
git clone https://github.com/Jacotsu/Mpeg7Dupes
cd Mpeg7Dupes
make release
```

### Optional: integration with shell
Copy `./bin/mpeg7DupesRelease.elf` in `$HOME/.local/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`

# Usage

Generate your file signatures with the following command.
```
ffmpeg -i input.mkv -vf signature=filename=signature.bin -map 0:v -f null -
```
Keep in mind that only binary signatures are supported at the moment.

Then compare the signatures with the following command
```
./bin/mpeg7DupesRelease.elf {signature 1} {signature 2} ...
```

Or create a `list` of files, like the following
```
{path to file 1}
{path to file 2}
{path to file 3}
...
{path to file n}
```
And then launch mpeg7Dupes
```
./bin/mpeg7DupesRelease.elf -l list_of_files
```
